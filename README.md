# FlowRouter SSR

This is the SSR version of FlowRouter and this will be the [FlowRouter 4.0](https://kadira.io/blog/meteor/flow-router-4-0-and-future-of-routing-in-meteor). This is compatibile with FlowRouter 2.x except for [subscription registration](https://github.com/kadirahq/flow-router#subscription-management). It has been removed from this version.

So, for the FlowRouter related documentation, visit [here](https://github.com/kadirahq/flow-router).

## Installation

* First Remove `kadira:flow-router` or `meteorhacks:flow-router` from your app
* Then add `kadira:flow-router-ssr` with `meteor add kadira:flow-router-ssr`

## Usage

> Currently, SSR only works with React. It's technically possible to add SSR support for Blaze. But Blaze Templates are not available on the server. We'll figure out something for that.

You need to write your app with FlowRouter and [ReactLayout](https://github.com/kadirahq/meteor-react-layout). Visit here to [learn](https://kadira.io/academy/meteor-routing-guide/content/rendering-react-components) how to do that.

* Write your app in a place it's expose to both client and the server. You need to do it for both for the router and for React components.
* Use Meteor's react [integration](https://github.com/meteor/react-packages)
* Use subscriptions inside your component, so FlowRouter can detect them fetch data for SSR.
* Now your code runs on both on the client and the server, so make special attention to that. (Always, check the server console for errors)
* If you need to write client specific code, write it in `componentDidMount` life cycle method - It doesn't run on the server.

## Subscriptions & Collection Data

It's important to note that in order to simulate the **client state** on the **server**, FlowRouter SSR only makes available collection data *that you've subscribed to*, even on the server.

In other words, if you write something like `Posts.find().fetch()`, it will return the same exact posts on both the client and server while called by FlowRouter SSR, even though more posts are (presumably) available on the server when accessed through normal means. 

Aditionally, since server code is not reactive you should always `subscribe()` first before trying to retrieve data with `fetch()`, otherwise you'll only get an empty array in return.

## Caching

Rendering React Components are extremely [CPU intensive](https://twitter.com/kadirahq/status/620467416749838336) on the server. This will negatively impact your app's peformance specially if you've high page view throughput.

To get rid of this, we must run our app with a some sort of caching layer. 

So, FlowRouter comes with a built-in caching layer. It caches pages based on the loggedIn user and the URL.

This how you can enable the cache:

~~~js
if(Meteor.isServer) {
  var timeInMillis = 1000 * 10; // 10 secs
  FlowRouter.setPageCacheTimeout(timeInMillis)
}
~~~

With this, FlowRouter will cache pages and clear them after 10 seconds.

> By default, page cache is **turned off**.

**This is a smart cache and once your DDP connection sends actual data, cache will get invalidated locally.**

## Meta tags

You can directly set metatags that will be added on the server as so:

```js
FlowRouter.route('/path', {
  name: 'someRoute',
  getMetaTags: () => ({
    description: 'My cool webpage'
    'og:image': 'someImageUrl',
  }),
  ...
});
```

and set default metatags for that will be used if not overwritten as:

```js
FlowRouter.defaultMetaTags = {
  'og:title': 'My cool website',
};
```

## Defer Script Loading

In a normal Meteor app we need to load 500KB - 2MB JavaScript and run those JavaScript before the browser start to render anything. So, JavaScript blocks the rendering.

FlowRouter has an option which defer script loading. Then once the browser received the html it can render without waiting for JavaScript. 

This is a huge improvement and works even with very slow internet connections. To experience this just visit <https://kadira.io>

To enable this, simply apply following:

~~~js
if(Meteor.isServer) {
  FlowRouter.setDeferScriptLoading(true);
}
~~~

## Can I use this on Production?

It's depend on how you write your app. We are 80% feature complete and now we can call this is in alpha stage. At Kadira we use this in production for our main site. <https://kadira.io>.

But, we might have breaking changes. We'll try to maintain semver, but that's not a promise.
